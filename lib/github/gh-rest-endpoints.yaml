# GitHub REST API Endpoint Templates
# Collection of REST API endpoints for operations not available via GraphQL
# Use with: gh api [endpoint] [options]

# =============================================================================
# MILESTONES - Repository-level milestone management
# =============================================================================
# Note: Creating/updating/closing milestones requires REST API.
# GraphQL only supports reading milestones and setting them on issues/PRs.
